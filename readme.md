# C++ cortex-m hardware library

![klib library](https://github.com/itzandroidtab/klib/actions/workflows/cmake.yml/badge.svg)

Klib uses `cmake` and `arm-none-eabi-gcc` to build excecutables for cortex targets. Currently supported targets can be found in the [target folder](./targets/).

Support for devices varies. Currently some targets have a startup file that can be enabled by adding `startup.cpp` to the target `CMakeLists.txt`. This means by default the coprocessors are not enabled and the cpu clock may not be initialized to the full clock speed.

## Starting your first project

:warning: This project needs the header file generated from the `.svd` of the manufacturer. Header file should be placed in in the targets/target folder with the same name as the target folder and should be generated by the CMSIS `svdconv` utility.

### Selecting target cpu
To select a target cpu the target cpu needs to be added to the commandline when configuring cmake. 

(e.g. To configure cmake for the max32660, run the following command)
```sh
cmake -B ./build -DTARGET_CPU=max32660
```
This configures the project for the specific target cpu. To change to a different target, the project has to be reconfigured.

### Selecting board 
To make it easier to use the pins of a specific development board a target board can be selected. To include a board another option needs to be added to the commandline. 

(e.g. To configure cmake for the max32660 evsys board, run the following command)
```sh
cmake -B ./build -DTARGET_CPU=max32660 -DTARGET_BOARD=evsys
```

#### Setup VSCode
(When using vscode with the cmake plugin the following can be added to the `settings.json` to configure cmake for the max32660 evsys board)
```json
{
    "cmake.configureArgs": [
        "-DTARGET_CPU=max32660",
        "-DTARGET_BOARD=evsys"
    ],
    "C_Cpp.default.configurationProvider": "ms-vscode.cmake-tools",
}
```

### Main file
By default klib has no `main.cpp` file. This has to be created by the user. To use the klib target system `klib.hpp` needs to be included. 

When a specific board is not found within a target cpu this include will give a error the file `boards/TARGET_BOARD/pins.hpp` cannot be found.

Minimal main file:
```cpp
#include <klib/klib.hpp>

int main() {
    return 0;
}
```

## Using klib
Klib has most library functions documented using doxygen (there is no config file). Please refrence the doxygen/doxywizzard documentation to generate the documentation. 

### Interrupt handling
By design klib has a default vector table that should not be changed. Instead it has a method to move the vector table to ram. This allows more flexibility to change the vector table at runtime. To use interrupts, use the following file as reference [irq.hpp](./klib/irq.hpp)
